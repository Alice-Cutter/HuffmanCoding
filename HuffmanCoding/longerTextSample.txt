Hello there, this is me a Carleton College student writing a paragraph for our program. I am doing it to show that our Huffman Compression algorithm works for smaller texts but also larger ones like this. I will now continue typing to add some depth to this paragraph but it really has no concrete meaning. Just typing away in a study room pretending to do work. You know the vibe. I hope they restock the vending machine soon as I am hungry.
